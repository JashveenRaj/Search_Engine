# Search Engine Lab

## Project Overview

This project is a Search Engine Lab that serves as the final project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course provided by Amazon( https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-data-structures-and-algorithms/home/week/1]). It demonstrates the application of key data structure concepts and algorithms to develop a basic search engine.

## Project Features

- **Data Structures Used**: The project implements and utilizes various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and hash maps.
- **Algorithms**: Key algorithms for searching, sorting, and data manipulation are employed to handle and query data efficiently.
- **Testing**: JUnit is used for unit testing to ensure code reliability and correctness.

## Methodologies Used

The project follows the following methodologies:

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- The design is modular, using classes and objects to represent core components of the search engine.
- Encapsulation is applied to maintain data integrity.
- Inheritance and polymorphism are leveraged for extending functionalities.

### 2. Data Structure Implementation

- **ArrayList**: Used for dynamic data storage.
- **HashMap**: Employed for efficient key-value lookups.
- **Linked List**: Utilized for handling sequential data.
- **Stack**: Implemented for managing nested data operations, such as parsing expressions.

### 3. Algorithmic Techniques

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implemented for data organization and optimization.
- **Search Algorithms**: Used for efficient data retrieval.
- **Balanced Parentheses Checking**: Utilized stacks to ensure matching opening and closing brackets.

### 4. JUnit Testing

- Unit tests were written using JUnit to verify the correctness of methods and data structure operations.
- Tests ensure that functions perform as expected, with edge cases checked to maintain robust behavior.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how data structures and algorithms can be implemented in a real-world application. The use of JUnit ensures that all implemented features work as expected, making this project an effective demonstration of key programming concepts.
